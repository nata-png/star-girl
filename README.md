# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is my first React-Project
i worked a lot to have everything on this project and fine 
the props and components 
i created an account , verified my email,set up my profile , installed git 
linked my local repository
using the command git remote add origin 
pushed my code using git push -m origin master
I also used useState and useEffect 
usState allows you to add state to a functional component 
useEffect allows you to run side effects e.g setting up an event listener ,after rendering a component 
i used this steps to have my project running being push from vs code to my acount (git hub repository)
git init
git status 
git add .
git commit -m"react-project"
